# SI649-GroupProj

The web app we built in this project can be used by people interested in learning how personal demographic information and life habits can influence the chance of getting heart disease. 

The web app provides the following features:
1. See a sample of raw data that we used for building the visualizations and regression model by clicking the expander box. 
2. Visualizations to show the relationship between heart disease and other variables.
3. Predict the probability of getting heart disease by inputting your personal information (e.g., age, gender, race, sleep time, etc.).

In addition, we want to thank the author Kamil Pytlak who created another web app for predicting the heart disease probability. We got some inspiration from the app(https://heart-condition-checker.herokuapp.com/) he created.
